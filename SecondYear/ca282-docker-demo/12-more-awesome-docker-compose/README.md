For more awesome docker compose demonstrations,
clone [this repo](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) from GitHub.

Try the `flask` project.  This is brings up just a single docker image.  However, observe that
all of the configuration information (e.g. ports, container name, etc), which was previously on the command
line, is now in the configuration file.

Try `wordpress-mysql`.  This brings up two containers: one for Wordpress, and one for its mySQL storage
engine.
