This repo contains a sequence of docker projects, each demonstrating some docker feature
or element of docker usage.

In each subdirectory:

- a `README.md` explains the demo, and
- a `Makefile` contains the various docker commands for the demo.

The subdirectories are ordered.

Separately, there's an introduction to docker here: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/.
