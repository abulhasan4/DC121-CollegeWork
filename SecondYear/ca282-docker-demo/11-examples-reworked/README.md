This directory contains some of the previous examples, but reworked
to use `docker compose`.

That is, the containers are configured by a `docker-compose.yml` configuration
file, rather than the details being spread around individual commands (in Makefiles).

The resulting configurations are considerably simplified, and the make files are all almost identical.
