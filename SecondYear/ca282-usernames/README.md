Test repo for CA282.

The directory users should contain exactly one file for each student on this module.

Your task is to create a file **users/USERNAME,** where **USERNAME** is replaced with your username.

The contents of the file do not matter, just the name.

Note that there is no extension on the file name.

There's an example for the user **aslaimi** already in the users directory.

Commit your change, push it back to your repo on GitLab, and submit a merge request.

Merge requests will be accepted so long as:


- they are not from your master branch,
- they do not include extraneous commits, and
- they contain reasonable commit messages.

Be careful!
If you get your username wrong, then you may not receive your marks.
Do not remove any files.

Tips
Be careful that you do not clone this repo
create your own fork first, then clone that fork.
Remember to create new branch before adding your new file.
